# Bitcoin-Network-Tracker

This is a script that tracks the current price of BTC through Blockchain.com's socket API. The script looks for any transactions broadcasted out to the network. It will notify if any transaction exceeds a threshold USD worth of BTC. The price of BTC is updated every ten seconds. There's two files in here, one which is a normal script and another with a discord notification bot tied to it. To run the discord notification you must input your bot key and have your bot added.
